Feature: Multi Input Field Edit
  As a user
  I want to add, delete and edit multi input field

  Background: Create a list
    Given I am on the new configuration page
    And I enter the form name "smoke-tests-list-components"
    When I submit the form with the button title "Next"
    When I open "Lists"
    And I open the link "Add a new list"
    * I enter "Types of egg" for "List title"
    * I add the list items
      | text          | help                   | value     |
      | sunny-side up | fried but not flipped  | sunny     |
      | over-easy     | fried and flipped over | over-easy |
      | scrambled     |                        | scrambled |
      | raw           |                        | raw       |
    * I save the list
    * I close the flyout

      | First page | Multi Input Field | Which eggs do you like? |
    And I add table title name "Textfield"
    * I add table title name "Numberfield"
    * I add table title name "Radiofield"
    * I add table title name "Datepartsfield"
    * I add table title name "Websitefield"
    * I add table title name "YesorNofield"
    * I add table title name "MonthYearfield"
    * I add table title "This is a table title"
    And I add child components

    And I save component
    And I preview the page "First page"
    Then I see following components in the page
